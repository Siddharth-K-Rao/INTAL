# INTAL
An intal is a non negative integer of arbitrary length. The integer is stored as a null-terminated string of ASCII characters. An intal is represented as a string of decimal digits ('0' thru '9') that are stored in the big-endian style. That is, the most significant digit is at the head of the string.
