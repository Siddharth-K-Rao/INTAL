# INTAL
An intal is a non negative integer of arbitrary length. The integer is stored as a null-terminated string of ASCII characters. An intal is represented as a string of decimal digits ('0' thru '9') that are stored in the big-endian style. That is, the most significant digit is at the head of the string.
Here, we are performing basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and finding power of two numbers along with the GCD and factorial of a number.
